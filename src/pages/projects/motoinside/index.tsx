    description: "I developed a webpage for a motocross company in the Netherlands. This site serves as an advertisement for motocross events and features a contact form for requesting quotes. The objective is to support users of motorsport facilities, such as circuits, through a freely available app. The goals include maintaining and developing future-proof motorsport venues, attracting new fans and participants, and organizing and facilitating promotional motorsport events. Additionally, there is a focus on encouraging young people to pursue education and careers in the technical sector. I built the website from scratch using Webflow inlcluding embedded source code for graphs, with the design created in Figma.",
